    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. What Cookies We Use and Why</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">We only use cookies that are essential for the operation of the Service. Specifically, these cookies are used to:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li><strong>Session Token</strong>: Stores an encrypted `session_token` when a user logs in with Spotify, allowing us to maintain the user's session securely throughout their use of the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary Session</strong>: Stores an encrypted `temporal_session` for users who join a party by entering a name only (without logging in), ensuring smooth access to the party without the need for a full account.</li>
      <li><strong>OAuth State</strong>: Stores an encrypted state value required to perform OAuth authentication securely, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring a secure login process.</li>
    </ul>
